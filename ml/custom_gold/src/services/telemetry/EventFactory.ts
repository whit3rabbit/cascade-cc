// Logic from chunk_502.ts (ii2)

// import { validateEvent } from './telemetryValidation.js'; // Assuming this exists or I need to create it. 
// Actually validateEvent is di2/AU0 in chunk_502. I might need to implement it too.

import { v4 as uuid } from 'uuid'; // or use our util

// For now, I'll inline the simple validation or create a separate file later if needed.
// chunk_502 has AU0 (validation).

// ... I'll implement EventFactory later as it's not strictly required for ToolCallItem UI.
// ToolCallItem only uses the component parts.
// The user request is about ToolCallItem.tsx.
// I'll skip EventFactory for now unless needed.
